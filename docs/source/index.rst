exprmat Documentation
=====================

`exprmat` is a Python package to manipulate single cell expression matrices or
alike. It is maintained as a integrative platform for all-in-one downstream
analysis of common gene or fragments-based expression matrices (commonly produced
in single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT/Tag-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq or MNase-seq)

This package is in early development, and the APIs are not stable. It is not planned
to be stable until the release. (Major version 1). We do not include any 
external dependencies other than the depended Python packages. Especially, we 
try to avoid program level interaction between R and other commandline tools.
