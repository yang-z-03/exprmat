Exprmat (short for **expr**ession **mat**rix) is a routine package for manipulation 
of single cell expression matrices. It is built based on commonly accepted python
infrastructures for single cell data management (Scanpy, SnapAtac2, and MuData) and
provides integration and wrappers of common routines for preprocessing, annotating,
clustering, visualizations, and downstream analysis in a common interface.
